#Step 2:

#Understanding and planning:
->The data science project involves modelling the success of video games, discovering the importance of individual features and then creating an interactive web app.
The web app will allow a game developer to inpuit and modify a game design in order to maximize the predicted success given the resources available.
->Planning with the GitHub feature called "Kanban" style project board that will complete steps automatically after you merge a pull request for the specific issue.
